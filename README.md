Decentralized Anonymus Conversation Application, or DACA, is an application to encourage people to have conversation, but at the same time securing their identity by not revealing their information, including username, age, gender, etc.

To log in and start using DACA, one must ensure that extension for decentralized wallet is installed in their browser such as Metamask. Therefore, one could log on to DACA easily without inputting their credentials such as username and password. 
Unlike the old fashion log in method, one could access to DACA by signing via the pop-up message through their decentralized wallet.

Also, to ensure users have the ability to control and modify their data, users can go to the 'Profile' section to modify their details. Optionally, users can delete their account where the user's data will be vanished from our database record.
